Introduction:
Alphabet Soup is a nonprofit foundation that is searching for a tool that can help it select applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. The purpose of this analysis is to develop a binary classifier that utilizes the features within the provided dataset to predict the likelihood of success for applicants funded by Alphabet Soup. To accomplish this, deep learning techniques, specifically deep neural networks, will be employed to extract data features and design target-oriented algorithms.

Steps:
Data Preprocessing:
Prior to inputting the data into the deep learning model, the dataset underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure the data's suitability and integrity.

Model Compilation, Training, and Evaluation:
The dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets. During the training phase, the model's performance was assessed using the validation set, and adjustments were made to optimize its accuracy.

Summary:
The deep learning model achieved a classification accuracy of 73% on the test set, demonstrating its ability to predict with reasonable accuracy whether applicants funded by Alphabet Soup will be successful.
